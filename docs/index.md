**CleanQRL** is a Reinforcement Learning library specifically tailored to the subbranch of Quantum Reinforcement Learning and is greatly inspired by the amazing work of **[CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl)**. Just as the classical analougue, we aim to provide high-quality single-file implementation with research-friendly features. The implementation follows mainly the ideas of **[CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl)** and is clean and simple, yet can scale nicely trough additional features such as **[ray tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html)**. The main features of this repository are


* ðŸ“œ Single-file implementations of classical and quantum version of 5+ Reinforcement Learning agents 
* ðŸ’¾ Tuned and Benchmarked agents (with available configs)
* ðŸŽ® Integration of gymnasium, mujoco and jumanji
* ðŸ“˜ Examples on how to enhance the standard QRL agents on a variety of games
* ðŸ“ˆ Tensorboard Logging
* ðŸŒ± Local Reproducibility via Seeding
* ðŸ§« Experiment Management with [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)
* ðŸ“Š Easy and straight forward hyperparameter tuning with [ray tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html)

What we are missing compared to **[CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl)**:

* ðŸ’¸ Cloud Integration with docker and AWS 
* ðŸ“¹ Videos of Gameplay Capturing
